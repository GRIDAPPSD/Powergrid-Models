-- A wire or combination of wires, with consistent electrical characteristics,
-- building a single electrical system, used to carry alternating current
-- between points in the power system.
-- For symmetrical, transposed 3ph lines, it is sufficient to use attributes
-- of the line segment, which describe impedances and admittances for the
-- entire length of the segment. Additionally impedances can be computed by
-- using length and associated per length impedances.
-- The BaseVoltage at the two ends of ACLineSegments in a Line shall have
-- the same BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage. However, boundary lines may have slightly
-- different BaseVoltage.nominalVoltages and variation is allowed. Larger
-- voltage difference in general requires use of an equivalent branch.
