# IEEE 9500 Node Model

This repository contains OpenDSS files for the 9500 node test feeder

* [Common Information Model (CIM)](http://gridappsd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_resources/index.html#cim-documentation) 
* [GridLAB-D](http://gridlab-d.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Index) 
* [OpenDSS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/electricdss/)

from these sources:

* [IEEE Distribution Test Cases](http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/pes/dsacom/testfeeders/) 

The taxonomy feeders are modified, as described in the _taxonomy_ subdirectory.
